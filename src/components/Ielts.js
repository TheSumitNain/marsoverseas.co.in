          <li>IELTS Academic</li>
          <li>IELTS General</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>
          (You can choose any one from them according to your reason for taking
          IELTS.)
        </h5>
        <h5>IELTS Academic:</h5>
        <p>
          If you have a dream to get higher education or professional
          registration in various foreign English speaking countries then you
          need to clear the <span>IELTS Academic test</span>. It contains the
          features of academic language. Also, it will help to evaluate that,
          are you ready to begin studying or training or not. The academic IELTS
          is accepted by so many famous institutions of the world for the higher
          education.
        </p>
        <h5>IELTS General:</h5>
        <p>
          Candidates who want to go to the English speaking countries for work
          experience or training programs, they need to clear the IELTS General
          Training test. Also it is required when any individual wants to
          migrate to
          <span>Australia, New Zealand, Canada</span>, and the <span>UK</span>.
          This test is taken to examine the candidate’s original survival skills
          in broad social and workplace contexts.
        </p>
        <h5>IELTS IDP/ British Councli:</h5>
        <p>
          IELTS is a test which is invented by the British Council, IDP and
          University of Cambridge all together. In some countries, IDP is taking
          up the responsibility to conduct this test. There are some countries
          where the British Council took up the charge to conduct this test.
          Also in some countries both the IDP and British Council are in charge
          of this exam. India is also one of these countries where IELTS is
          offered by both the IDP and British Council. Just because of this
          reason most of the people get confused that where to go.
        </p>
        <p>
          But here is a very interesting fact about IELTS, which is an answer to
          all your questions. The fact is that the IELTS exams are the same in
          all over the world, whether you are giving it in any State, any City
          or In any Country. Just like the location also it does not matter
          whether you are giving your exam through IDP or British Council. The
          pattern of exams, questions as well as marking Criteria of IELTS will
          be always same in both conditions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here we found some students who say that the marking criteria of
          British Council IELTS is easier than the IDP IELTS, but it’s not true.
          Because both the examiners of BC and IDP get trained in the same
          manner. The marking criteria followed by the examiner are same for
          both the IDP and British Council. So simply, it does not matter
          whether you are choosing British Council or IDP for IELTS, you will
          get the same marks according to your preparation. So, prepare well by
          choosing a best <span>IELTS center</span>
          in your Nearby location and get success. Don’t waste your time in
          thinking about <span>British Council</span> or <span>IDP</span>. Just
          prepare well and get success.

        <h4>The Ielts Test Format</h4>
        <p>
          The Test consists of four modules, i.e. Listening, Reading, Writing
          and Speaking. Listening and speaking modules are common for all IELTS
          candidates, but it is necessary to choose an option between academic
          and general training for reading and writing modules.
        </p>

            <td>

              11 to 14 Minutes
            </td>
          </tr>
        </table>

        <h4>Test Duration: 2 hours 45 minutes</h4>
        <p>
          The first three modules, i.e. reading, listening and writing, are
          completed in one day. However, speaking modules can be taken at the
          discretion of the testing center on the same day or within the 7 days
          before or after the schedule of other modules. The tests are designed
          to cover the full range of capabilities from expert user to non-user.
        </p>
        <span>Note:</span>
        <p>
          Academic reading and writing modules are designed to assess the
          ability of studying or working through English at any graduate,
          postgraduate or professional level of any candidate.
        </p>
        <p>
          General training, reading and writing modules are not designed to test
          the full range of formal language skills needed for academic purposes,
          rather they emphasize basic living skills in a broad social and
          academic context. General Training is most suitable for candidates
          traveling in English-speaking countries, for immigration purposes like
          <span>Australia, Canada</span> and <span>New Zealand</span>, not to
          the degree level, but to undertake work experience or training
          programs. It is the sole responsibility of the candidate to inform the
          examination center about what he wants to do in the academic or
          general training module.

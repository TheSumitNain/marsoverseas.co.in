        <p>
          Follow these below <span>tips for pte exam</span> and know how to
          score 80+ in Pte.
        </p>

        <span>Understand The Basics:</span>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Understanding the scoring system of each question, can easily change
            the table in your favor.
          </li>
          <li>
            Pay close attention to the instructions provided in every question.
          </li>
          <li>
            Watch out for time limits. If it has a time limit, provide your
            response in the given time duration.
          </li>
          <li>
            Beware of negative marking questions. If there is a multi-choice
            answer, make sure not to answer unless you are absolutely sure.
          </li>
          <li>
            In speaking, maintain proper fluency and try speaking as natural and
            native-like you can.
          </li>
          <li>
            Try to avoid silly mistakes like spelling errors or forgetting the
            instructions or missing to listen to certain words.
          </li>
          <li>
            It is an entire computer-based exam, that does not depend on any
            human judgment or emotions.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <span>Look For Areas Where You Lack The Most:</span>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Knowing your suspicious subject areas will help you to work on them
            and rectify them.
          </li>
          <li>
            Have a thorough understanding of questions you are comfortable with
            and the ones that make you a little distressed.
          </li>
          <li>
            Remind yourself of how you once tackled a tough question and now you
            are pro at it. Seeing your achievements and mistakes regularly makes
            a picture of your current situation quite clear..
          </li>
          <li>Continuously challenge yourself and practice.</li>
        </ul>

        <span>PTE Follows A Unique Scoring Technique:</span>

        <ul>
          <li>
            For scoring, PTE not only considers your communicative skills but
            provides a proper review of you enabling skills as well.
          </li>
          <li>In speaking, you will need to have good listening skills.</li>
          <li>
            To write efficiently or answer reading questions, you must know the
            right vocabulary and have an understanding of the grammar and
            coherence.
          </li>
          <li>
            While listening, you will need to know the right spellings, or else
            you could lose a big deal of scores.
          </li>
          <li>
            Regular practice and getting evaluated on your daily attempts will
            help you know your exact position and will enable you to decide when
            to go for an actual PTE exam.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <span>Time Management And Focus Are The Key:</span>

        <ul>
          <li>
            These two qualities will win you half the battle. The other half is
            the right knowledge of English language.
          </li>
          <li>
            Time management comes with consistent practice. Mindfulness comes
            with concentration.
          </li>
          <li>
            Having outright presence of mind and staying alert definitely works
            when you want to score high in PTE.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h5>What score do I need?</h5>

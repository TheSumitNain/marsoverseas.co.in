        <h4>MBBS ABORAD</h4>
        <p>
          Medicine is one of the most popular careers paths across the world
          including India. The journey to becoming a doctor typically starts
          with gaining an MBBS degree. But, getting a medical seat in India is
          not fiercely competitive. Studying abroad is one of the best options
          for the students who didnâ€™t score a good rank in the NEET examination.
          Studying medicine abroad is comparatively less expensive and has a
          high ROI. There are many universities abroad that prefer taking the
          students from various countries to establish a positive co-culture
          environment. Foreign universities maintain high standards in terms of
          quality of education at cheaper / lesser fees when compared to India
